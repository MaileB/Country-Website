                    The traditional clothing of Peru is bright and colorful, and often consists of alpaca fur due to its insolation properties. <br>
                    The more common items are ponchos, ruanas, and perhaps the most iconic, chullo hats. <br>
                    The intricate patterns often represent cultural and spiritual beliefs carried down through the generations of peruvians.
